# == SANS 84 ==
Experience the hell that is the Sans fight from the comfort of your math class!
Programed for a TI-84 Plus CE.

**NOTE: THIS CODE IS TRASH!**
I used this project to begin to learn C. As such, if you actually know what you
are doing, I advise you to cover your eyes in fear.
Then, submit a pull request and show me how to do it *right*.

## How to Compile.
- TODO: GOOD LUCK

This uses a toolchain by the CE-Programing team, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
You can get the toolchain here: https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain

## TODO:
- "Attack" Rendering loop.
- HP Display
- Settle on a proper way to queue up attacks.
- When using NumPad, the buttons do not "hold", but the dumb arrows do.
